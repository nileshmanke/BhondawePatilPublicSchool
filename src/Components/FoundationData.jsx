        THE FOUNDATION YEARS PROGRAMME (The Primary School) encourages inquiry
        and exploration, and develops children's competence in various skills
        reading, writing, listening, speaking, problem-solving, observation,
        measurement and use of information and communications technology. It
        offers an exciting and creative learning environment, with an inter
        disciplinary appreciation of Languages, Mathematics, Science and Social
        Studies, as individual and integrated subjects. Hindi is taught as a
        Second Language, while Marathi language offered as the Third Language,
        which helps build a strong foundation in Regional language. The ICT
        helps students understand Information and Communications Technology and
        its benefits. Equal emphasis is given to individual, small group and
        whole-group activities, to improve children's ability to work across all
        levels. Physical Education develops sports skills and creates health
        awareness. Exposure to team and individual sports encourage a sense of
        team spirit, and individual effort and accomplishment. The wide range of
        curricular and co-curricular opportunities offered helps instil in
        children confidence and discipline. The focus on developing
        communication skills helps them appreciate the value of education, as it
        reflects in their ability to express themselves, in addition to
        developing pragmatic skills. Field trips, excursions, activities,
        projects and presentations provide experiential learning opportunities.
        Dance, Fine Arts, Western and Indian Music, Yoga, Speech and Drama
        promote well-rounded development. Students are encouraged to participate
        in inter-house cultural and sports events. Active learning techniques
        like free play, dramatisation, and puppetry, songs, dancing and cooking
        enhance their interest in learning. Book, newspaper and magazine reading
        activities increase children's awareness of the world. Assemblies,
        concerts and drama productions help shape their confidence. Student's
        engagement in community service activities from Class III onwards
        sensitises them to the needs of their community and to the world around
        them; they visit old-age homes and orphanages to understand their
        situations and also to support underprivileged children.
