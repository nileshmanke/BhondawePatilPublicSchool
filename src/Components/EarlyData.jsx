        EARLY YEARS PROGRAMME (The Kindergarten) inculcates in children the
        qualities of curiosity, exploration and discovery in a fun-filled, safe
        and happy learning environment. An individualised approach helps nurture
        a love of learning; develop social skills, and instil moral values. The
        emphasis is on developing in students, self confidence and the ability
        to effectively communicate in English as well as in their mother tongue;
        teachers ensure this through effective use of language and by
        encouraging children to express themselves freely. A well-balanced
        curriculum and theme-based instruction help the young minds integrate
        their learning smoothly. The emphasis is on exploring, knowing,
        understanding and forming their own ideas. The principles of learning
        applied in Kindergarten include Holistic Development and Learning
        (Aesthetics and Creative Expression, Language and Literacy, Numeracy,
        Self and Social Awareness); Integrated Learning; Active Learning:
        Supportive Learning: Interactive Learning and Learning through Play. The
        curriculum prepares children for a smooth transition to a more formal
        Primary curriculum. The Kindergarten Programme makes use of a range of
        individual and group activities which create a lively and positive
        learning environment. Games, songs, creative projects, story-telling,
        role-playing, drawing and painting help develop children"s foundational
        skills in literacy and numeracy. They are encouraged to play, explore
        and discover through dance, music, art and craft. Singing, rhyming and
        reciting are employed in the Language Arts, and the Phonics Programme.
        The use of manipulative, pictures and symbols helps them identify
        relationships between sets and groups of things to be sorted, counted,
        shared and represented. Sports and interactions with sports teachers
        help in strengthening coordination and motor skills, and instil
        enthusiasm for sports. Picnics and fields trips enhance students
        understanding of their surroundings. Celebration of festivals sensitises
        them to multiple traditions and cultures.
